Summary:
We present a multimodal continuous authentication framework that combines information of the hand movement and touchscreen interaction modalities. Unlike previous approaches which rely mostly on time domain data, our system exploits the spectrogram representation to extract valuable features which are not present in the temporal domain. Different inertial sensors are combined with the touchscreen interactions to achieve the best performance. Overall, the performance on the spectrogram representation outperforms time domain data signals, this demonstrates the potential of spectrgrams to spot relevant information in the time-frequency domain.
